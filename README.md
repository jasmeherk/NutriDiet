## CalorieTracker and Recommender


NutriDiet is a *CalorieTracking* app which will act as a diary for the food
that you eat and the fluids you consume. In addition to this functionality, 
it is also a *recommender* in the sense that it will tell you what to work on 
if you ask it based on the sigmoid function which essentially tells you how close you are to your goal. This function quantifies priority by standardising weight, 
calories, millilitres of fluid consumed etc into one form.

The target audience for this application is the general public which is health conscious as well as people who are trying to make a difference 
but don't know where they might be going wrong or have lost their path to a physically fit lifestyle. The *CalorieTracker* and *Recommender* 
ensure that you stay fit as you are able to track your eating habits, gym routine in general, your lifestyle.

I chose to do this project because often me and my gym partner weren't able to see results. We would work out regularly, however, 
didn't realise when we would be consuming unnecessary calories. Logging them into an application
where they will stay stored really helps you track your progress. That was my inspiration for this project.
